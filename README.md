This is the site for www.kavitareader.com.

This has a few functions for the kavita application. 

### Web Links
If you have a weblink that does not have a favicon in Kavita, you can upload it here and link it in /assets/favicons/urls.txt. Please upload everything through tinypng to reduce the size and keep the size around 32x32.

### Publishers
Kavita also has the ability to use Publisher images. You can upload your own in assets/publishers/publishers.txt. See the readme in that folder (about.txt) to understand the syntax.
