## What is Kavita+?

![](/uploads/illustrations/kavita+.webp)

Kavita+ is an optional service offered by the main developer of Kavita (majora2007) which unlocks a set of premium features for your Kavita install. Kavita+ is an avenue for majora2007 to go full time on Kavita development. Think of it as a way to support the development of Kavita while also getting some sweet features out of it. 

The goal is to not lock all features behind Kavita+, but add features that otherwise aren't feasible in the base product. The base Kavita application will continue to get frequent updates with new features.
