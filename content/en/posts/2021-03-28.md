I didn't think I'd release comic book support so soon, but it was easy to add and needed for my testers. You can now add a "Comic" library that will parse your comics and provide the same experience as your Manga.



Change log:

- Comic book support

- Lots of parsing fixes and enhancements for Manga

- Fixed scroll issue on context menu modal

- When server looses connection, try to put user back on original page from no-connection page.

- Enhanced the way we show "Specials" on series detail page. Now a "Specials" volume will show grouping all files that don't match. This will be enhanced in a future update.
