### Kavita+ Users, After updating, please DM/Email me to get your license reset for re-registering (Kavita+ -> Edit tab).



Another release so quickly? I'm trying out a new way to release Kavita releases to bring things faster and minimize the amount of regression testing I have to do each release. For the next few releases, each release will contain one or two features along with the usual bugfixes and tweaks. 



For those that have signed up for Kavita+, I want to thank you so much for giving it a shot. I have new features planned, but I want to ensure the foundation is solid first. I have been alerted of a few users that are having their fingerprints change during system reboots and whatnot. I believe I have fixed this. **You will need to get in contact (email or dm on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/b52wT37kt7)) with your license key and I will reset you in the backend.** 



I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your understanding while I work out supporting so many platforms for fingerprinting in an open source project (it makes it very challenging). **Again, after updating, please DM/Email me to get your license reset for re-registering (Kavita+ -> Edit tab).** 



One last thing on Kavita+, I understand that it is becoming difficult to communicate changes happening on Kavita+ and even Kavita as the services tie in together. I am working on setting up a solution to make it easier to get informed. In the meantime, Watching for releases in Github or joining [discord](https://discord.com/invite/b52wT37kt7) and subscribing to Kavita+ (or other roles) will be the best. 



**A reminder if you are having any issues with Kavita+ to reach out in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/b52wT37kt7). If you have ideas for new features, please add on [Feat Hub](feats.kavitareader.com).**



Now back to Kavita! This release we see the addition of two cool features: Remove from On Deck and Overall Ratings. Overall ratings is a new feature that allows any series within your Kavita instance to show the average rating from other users (in addition to you own). A nice feature that drives more intra-server communication, something I'm looking to explore more in the future.

The big feature is Remove from On Deck. On deck are series that have recently had a new chapter within 7 days or reading activity within 3 weeks. These numbers are now customizable, but what if you have a series you just started reading but didn't vibe with. It would be annoying seeing it every day on your On Deck. You could previously mark as unread or just wait (or read a bunch of stuff to move it further down the list). Now, you can just remove it. Once removed, it wont be shown until you create any reading progress on it. You can remove it as many times as you need.





# Added

- Added: (Kavita+) Added favorite count on AL and MAL ratings. Click them to see the favorite count from users.

- Added: Added the ability to change cache memory amount from the Admin dashboard

- Added: Kavita users can now see the overall review from all user ratings for a given series. This rating will show in addition to your rating. Your rating + overall rating. You can click on the rating indicator to add your own.

- Added: Admins can now configure the amount of progress time or last item added range for on deck calculation

- Added: Added the ability for users to remove series from on deck. A series will no longer appear on 'On Deck' until a new chapter is read by that user.

- Added: Added the ability to see the last reading date for a volume or chapter in the details drawer. Hover over the clock to get the full timestamp.



# Changed

- Changed: (Kavita+) Review cards will now show an icon to indicate where the review is from. This may take some time to show as reviews are cached for some days in Kavita+

- **Changed: (Kavita+) Changed the fingerprinting method for Kavita+ (this requires re-registering after pinging me). Sorry for the issues.**

- Changed: (Kavita+) Don't allow Comic Libraries to do any scrobbling as there aren't any Comic Scrobbling providers yet

- Changed: Kavita+ tab now links directly to the FAQ

- Changed: Don't log that we are checking license when no license is set (no checking was taking place)

- Changed: Added an FAQ link on the Kavita+ tab

- Changed: Don't query Kavita+ for ratings on comic libraries as there are no upstream providers yet.

- Changed: Unified all caching in Kavita under one cache (Kavita+, favicons, etc) which is controlled by Cache setting in appsettings.json or via the Admin page. 

- Changed: Upped the default cache memory requirements to 75MB. 

- Changed: (Performance) Reduced a DB lookup for many reader based APIs.

- Changed: Ignore .caltrash folders during scan for users that use Calibre's managed directory as library folder



# Fixed

- Fixed: Jumbar keys were a little hard to click on

- Fixed: Fixed an issue where libraries that don't allow scrobbling could be scrobbled when generating past history with read events when a scrobble token was added

- Fixed: The min/max year on metadata filter was not a number input type. 

- Fixed: Fixed the disabled tabs color contrast due to bootstrap undocumented changes

- Fixed: Fixed an issue where Cache key was using Port instead. 

- Fixed: Fixed an issue where get latest progress would throw an exception if there was no progress due to LINQ and MAX query

- Fixed: Fixed a bug where Send To Device on a series card (like from library details) wouldn't actually send anything 

- Fixed: Ensure we sync to the DB for what's in appsettings.json for Cache Key

- Fixed: Fixed a bug where if you have multiple libraries pointing to the same folder (for whatever reason), the Scan Folder api could be rejected.

- Fixed: Handle more appropriately if the publication date from an epub is empty to avoid a bad parse error
