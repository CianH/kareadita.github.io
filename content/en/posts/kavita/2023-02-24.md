If you are on nightly, you can stay on your current nightly, you will not receive an update. If you are on stable and have been having issues updating to v0.7.1, use this version. From our Synology tester, this will fix your issues.



## Fixed

- Fixed: You can no longer run the docker as non-root (Reverts functionality as it was breaking Synology installs)
