With this release I can now ditch Ubooquity - my previous manga server of choice - with Kavita for all my reading needs. I would consider this as a full release with manga being it's primary focus over standard comic books. That being said, Kavita has a long road ahead filled with a host of new feature possibilities, like Book support, or proper metadata support. 



The change log is as follows (plus many other things I probably forgot):

- Image loading and Caching has been completely rewritten. Caching during manga reading is now super fast, you will forget you're reading over a network connection. Almost all images in the app are now lazy loaded with caching done by the browser

- Archive Support has been expanded to include RAR and many other various zipping formats thanks to using SharpCompress

- You can now access context menus from series detail page

- There is now pagination on series detail view, defaulting to 30 series per page

- ComicInfo.xml from within your archives will now populate the summary field on series during library scan

- You can now correct and fix matches on parsed series. e.g. Did Kavita think "One-Punch Man" was "One-Punch Men"? Correct it and future scans will ensure it parses as One-Punch Man

- You can now edit series metadata in the app + write your own review

- You can now search and navigate to any series from anywhere in the app

- Complete UX overhaul for better support on phone, tablet, or PC
