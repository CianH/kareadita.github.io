Due to some issues with paths, Linux users were unable to create a library. This and a few more bugs have been squashed in this release.



Change log:

- Date format on Volumes was showing incorrectly, removed as it's pointless (Last Modified) and replaced with Is Special designation.

- Changed all dates to be of format MM/dd/YYYY

- Fixed a bug with scrollbars in context modals

- Fixed a bug where Specials were showing twice

- First flow, ensure we go directly to library tab from "Create a library" link

- After a user registers for the first time, ensure we put them directly on login page

- Fixed directory picker not working consistently with windows and linux based paths.

- Fixed a bug where if a chapter had multiple archive files, they wouldn't all be extracted and thus you'd only be able to read up to the first archive. Now all are uncompressed and the reader will seamlessly switch between them.
