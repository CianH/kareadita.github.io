There have been a significant amount of reports that users are struggling to receive the email link for email migration or they are unable to find in their logs (usually due to a logging level mismatch). We have altered the migration code to not require any email to be clicked and instead as long as you pass correct login credentials, email migration will successfully validate. 



We will continue to look into the email functionality and smooth out existing flows. Thank you for being understanding.



# Changed:

- Changed: Email migration will now auto validate the email as long as user provides the correct username/password
