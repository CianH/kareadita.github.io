It has come to my attention that PDF rendering broke on 32-bit Pis due to a downstream dependency and a .net regression. The downstream library has put a workaround and we have confirmed it works in this. Sorry for the inconvenience. This will be the last hotfix.



# Added

- Added: Backup now includes your themes folder.



# Fixed

- Fixed: Fixed an issue where PDFs would not render on 32-bit Pi's due to a dependency having a bug. 

- Fixed: Fixed a copy issue where sometimes non-existent files would cause existent files to not copy during backup

- Fixed: Fixed a bug where bottom action bar on the book reader would have side-effects that top didn't, like settings button wouldn't open the drawer.
