This update is essentially 2 weeks of bugfixing and battle testing for existing Comics and Manga support. After these 2 weeks, I am positive this release is stable and can hold over anyone until the next release (v0.4 - book support). 



# New

- More cover Image enhancements. Files with "cover" or "folder" are now taken before the first file

- Parsing enhancements that translate chapters with "b" suffix to ".5" ie) Chapter 202b -> Chapter 202.5

- Many performance enhancements to ensure the scan loop works faster and uses less memory. After initial scan, my test library of 230GB of manga takes 3 seconds to update new series.

- Library cards are now alphabetically sorted on Homepage

- Special grouping from last release has been refined and more specials are encapsulated, giving you ultimate control over reading order.

- MANY parsing enhancements/fixes to cover many new scenarios found in the wild

- Series reviews and summaries are now truncated by a read more button if they are longer than 250 characters

- Series reviews are much easier to make and edit

- When an archive cannot be read, we show a custom message and card design to inform the user

- On Connection Lost when user refreshes browser, we will try to go back to page they lost connection on



# Fixed

- In Progress stream leaving old series due to abandoned rows being left in the DB

- In Progress stream was not ordered according to reading activity

- Don't allow specials to generate the series cover image (unless there are no better covers)

- Search doesn't show results when user searches with a localized name

- When changing the Name of a Series, it is being reset after a Scan Library

- Many areas weren't using a natural sort, so things like page 2, page 10 would cause page 10 to come first

- If a file was bound to a chapter, then extension changed, the file would stay with the chapter after a Scan Library, even though it's no longer on disk.

- Read vs Continue button wasn't showing correctly based on reading progress

- Go to Page (click the progress button) was off by 1

- Hitting Go to First page button would cycle through a virtual page split if the first page was a split page

- 2 split pages in a row would cause the second page to be shown as a normal page

- After updating a user library access, underlying page wouldn't show [Admin]

- Series' Summary and Reviews do not respect newline characters
