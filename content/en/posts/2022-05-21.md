v0.5.3 is here and packed full of a collection of random features I wanted to build out for Kavita. I usually plan out the next few releases and stick to that schedule, adding in features that I want or users suggest randomly, but this time I wanted to sit down and take a release for myself to work on whatever I felt like, rather than what I had planned and it turned out to be really fun and some great additions came from it. 



Let's start with what the discord community is abuzz about and that's the fated book reader refresh. Started last release but pushed due to complexity was a big refresh to the UX around the book reader and bringing one of our most up-voted [feature request](https://feats.kavitareader.com/posts/6/render-epub-mobi-in-screen-size-chunks-layout-like-calibre-web), calibre-like reading. Not only did we bring this reading mode to Kavita's reader, we also brought along new color themes for the reader for our OLED users, a font for Dyslexic users, and immersive mode, which hides the menuing system and lets you focus just on your book (goes great with column layout). It's been great iterating on the book reader since it was first built. I can't wait to see how it evolves and is polished further in later releases.



Next is my personal favorite and another coming from [feature request](https://feats.kavitareader.com/posts/41/interlinking-of-series-books), Series relations. Isn't it really annoying reading a series and not knowing what the next series is or what spin-offs exist? Well, now you can configure this into Kavita. From any series you can configure relationship links to other series, like sequels, prequels, spin off, side story, alternative version, etc. There are many links to choose from. You can see a little teaser of it below. Jump on our wiki to learn more about the [feature](https://wiki.kavitareader.com/en/guides/get-started-using-your-library/series-relationships).

Another killer addition is a big update to our search. You spoke and I heard you, you can now search for individual titles (book or manga/comics) and for individual files in addition to series, genres, people, tags, reading lists, libraries, collections, etc. This was tricky to implement and still retain the non-functional requirement of everything responding under 300ms. There should be no issues with you finding things in your server. 



Wrapping it up is a few small but powerful ones. Likely you've seen it a few times in your logs, but the old constraint issue. I finally was able to track it down and squash it for good. It ended up being an index in the database that wasn't actually being used. Another one is the extra white space on the right side of the card grid system. Robbie was able to drive a beautiful solution and it works just as I envisioned. Lastly, On Deck was tweaked yet again to try to achieve a good balance of how I want it vs how I can actually code it and we have found a good compromise that works. 



As usual, the release is packed with many things, so read through the changelog. To close off, I want to say thank you for all the support and suggestions to help shape Kavita. I have a lot of ideas that I want to see realized and really appreciate the inputs that have helped us build out Kavita. 



**Note: Kavita releases will slow down for a while as I have taken a new job. I am still committed to bringing my vision of Kavita to life, so don't worry about this project dying. I use Kavita daily.**



# Added

- Added: Users can now start reading from any chapter within a Reading List

- Added: Reading lists now have Cover images like Collection tags (https://feats.kavitareader.com/posts/89/adding-cover-images-to-reading-lists)

- Added: Added ability to filter series on a collection page

- Added: Library detail, all series, and collection page filtering will now persist in the url. This allows you to make a filter, click a series and hit back in browser to load the screen as it was, on the same page with the same filter as previously.

- Added: Card's progress bars will now automatically reflect a users' reading status in real time as a user is reading in real time without refreshing

- Added: Added a new Sort by field on filtering, Last Chapter Added, to help users sort in a way that mimics On Deck

- Added: Edit Series modal information tab will now show Last Chapter Added and Last Read Progress

- Added: Added a link to the wiki for stat collection to help users understand exactly what we collect on the setting field

- Added: GIF image types are now supported

- Added: Bookmarks are now moved out of user settings and are their own page on side nav.

- Added: Bookmarks can now be read by clicking on the series they are from, which will open the manga reader for that set of bookmarks.

- Added: Users can now link series together via Edit Series modal. Linked series will show on Series detail page under the Related tab. 

- Added: Kavita will now read and group based on the LocalizedSeries tag within ComicInfo. This is not an official tag, but an issue is raised on Anansi Project. This tag maps to Series LocalizedName field.

- Added: Library Detail now has 2 tabs: Library and Recommendation. Library is your library and recommendation is detailed below.

- Added: Library Detail Recommendation tab now has actual recommendations. A first pass, we now show (for the current library only): On Deck, Quick Reads (series that are not read, not ongoing, and are under 4k pages), Highly Rated (series rated by any user on the server with more than 4 stars, sorted by average star count), Rediscover (series that you're already read), and lastly More In (more in a given genre).

- Added: Users can now search directly for files within Kavita. Clicking on the file will open the respective series.

- Added: Users can now search against Chapters with TitleName set. TitleName is extracted from the Title field in ComicInfo or the book name from Epubs (i.e. if you search 'Stone' and have a series of Harry Potter, 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' will show up as it's the 2nd book in the series)

- Added: Added total pages to series info modal

- Added: When a file doesn't exist on disk but still in Kavita and the user tries to read it, throw an error and show it on the UI rather than just spin forever.

- Added: New book reader drawer design. Drawer has been redesigned to break up settings and table of content to reduce the amount of scrolling and to provide a cleaner UX.

- Added: Column layout (1 or 2 column) is now available in the book reader. This is a no-scroll solution which works best on e-ink readers.

- Added: New coloring themes for the book reader. Users can now choose between Dark (existing), Light (existing), or Black (new, all black)

- Added: Blacklist .qpkg folders and don't scan Recently-Snapshot or recycle folders.

- Added: New OpenDyslexic font for the book reader

- Added: You can now hide the action bar (top/bottom bar) in the book reader by using Interactive Mode. Interactive mode will automatically turn on tap to paginate and gives you a distraction free way to read. In order to show the drawer and top bar, you can tap in the document on a non-interactive element. 

- Added: Added --bulk-selection-highlight-text-color and --bulk-selection-text-color for bulk selection bar.

- Added: Added --search-result-text-lite-color for search results accent (where library is shown)

# Removed

- Removed: Removed Light and E-ink themes form Kavita. Less than 1% of users were using light or e-ink themes and the maintenance was high. These themes are offered on our [wiki](https://wiki.kavitareader.com/en/guides/settings/themes) to be used as a custom theme.



# Fixed

- Fixed: Fixed a bug where locked people fields on a series would be reset during a scan 

- Fixed: Fixed a type on sending when collection tag cover images are updated, thus user's not seeing updates without refreshing

- Fixed: Fixed a bug in typeahead when a partial filter is in place then using keyboard to select options, the wrong option would be picked.

- Fixed: Fixed a rare bug where an image could be cut off in some scaling modes in the manga reader.

- Fixed: Fixed a bug on getting publication status within a certain library which would fail due to how the query was written.

- Fixed: Fixed an issue where series with similar names would sometimes throw a constraint issue due to a custom DB index.

- Fixed: Fixed a bad parsing case for Series Name - Ch. 23.5 - Volume Extras

- Fixed: Fixed a bug stemming from the old db where duplicate issues could be added.

- Fixed: Fixed scroll to top not rendering or working due to the moving of scroll to body instead of window.

# Known Issues

- Firefox 100 has an issue with redirecting to the correct route when a user tries to load yoursite.com/ and will freeze up. This is a browser bug, you can use yoursite.com/login instead to avoid or use a different browser.

- Apple M1 chips are not supported for reading PDFs (if you host your server on a mac). The team is investigating a solution.
