There was a critical database exception that escaped testing and a hotfix had to be issued to fix it. 



# Fixed

- Database update during Scan Library would fail due to a constraint issue with SeriesMetadata table

- An edge case for Continue Reading button was caught where after marking a volume with multiple chapters as read/unread, the calculation for continue reading button wouldn't be properly updated



**Please update.**
