This was a fairly large release. This release originally was aimed at stabilizing and testing against a real library. During this, a ton of bugs were found that led to a complete rewrite to the DB structure and Scanning code. This helped Kavita have not only a more flexible structure, but improved matching and large speed ups. 



This release delivers the following:

- Stability & Bug fixes

- Ability to configure server settings 

- Ability to scheduler re-occurring Tasks

- Ability to mark a whole volume/chapter as read/unread

- Ability to reset user logins

- Ability to search library for items a user has access to

- Ability to log to file with rolling backups

- Ability to have user preferences reflect throughout app

- Ability to split full spread manga pages

- A full responsive pass-through on the app



Currently only building for Windows, create an issue if you want other OS builds.
